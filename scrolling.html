      <h2>How can I safely hide the design of the phone...</h2>
      <p>
        Our start-up provides you with everything you might need to customize your old (or even brand new!) phone. Browse our page to find the variety of options like pop sockets, covers, keychains and stickers. You can even use our fancy
        configurator to see what would go great together. Create your own sets, and weâ€™ll see if we want to make them - or just run away with your money.

      <h2>...that I bought for the design alone?</h2>

      <h2>But seriously...</h2>
      <p>
        All our creations are made on demand, which reduces waste. Our preferred materials are biodegradable and recyclable. Every year we donate 1% of our income to a charity dedicated to cleaning the seas - did you know that plastic keychains makes
        up to 15 tonnes of sea polution? Our diverse team creates the handmade products in a healthy and friendly atmosphere.
